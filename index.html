      <h2>Who We Are</h2>

      <p>
        Crawford Solutions is a healthcare technology company focused on
        designing practical workflow systems for hospital care teams.
        Our work is informed by firsthand clinical experience and a
        systems-level understanding of how care is delivered.
      </p>

      <p>
        We build tools that reduce friction in daily operations,
        support clearer prioritization, and help teams work more
        efficiently—without adding cognitive burden or disrupting
        established safety practices.

          <strong>Care-centered systems.</strong>
          Supporting care teams and patients through clearer,
          more equitable communication pathways.
