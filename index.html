      <h2>Our Approach</h2>

      <p>
        Crawford Solutions is a healthcare technology company focused on designing
        practical, systems-level tools informed by real clinical experience.
        Our work centers on reducing ambiguity, supporting equitable care,
        and helping care teams operate with greater clarity and efficiency.
      </p>

      <p>
        We believe effective healthcare systems should support clinicians,
        not add cognitive burden. Every solution we design prioritizes
        safety, transparency, and alignment with established clinical workflows.

      <h2>Design Principles</h2>

      <ul class="principles">
        <li>
          <strong>Clinician-informed.</strong>
          Designed by frontline healthcare professionals with a deep understanding
          of real-world hospital environments.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Equity-centered.</strong>
          Built to support patients with diverse communication needs,
          language preferences, and access barriers.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Systems-focused.</strong>
          Complements existing safety pathways rather than replacing them,
          integrating conservatively into clinical operations.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Operationally calm.</strong>
          Reduces unnecessary interruption, alarm fatigue,
          and back-and-forth communication.
        </li>
      </ul>

  <!-- PRODUCT OVERVIEW -->
  <section class="section">
    <div class="container">
      <h2>CareConnect</h2>

      <p>
        CareConnect is a digital patient request and triage platform designed to
        standardize request capture, support prioritization of time-sensitive versus
        routine needs, and route requests by clinical role.
      </p>

      <p>
        The system is designed to operate conservatively within hospital safety
        frameworks, providing clarity and visibility for care teams without
        introducing new risk pathways.
